_(...but primarily for running on Python 2.7 code)_

A cli tool to convert type annotations found in 'Google-style' docstrings (as understood and documented by the [Sphinx Napoleon](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) plugin) into PEP-484 type comments which can be checked statically using `mypy --py2`.

For an example of the format see https://github.com/anentropic/python-waterloo/blob/master/tests/fixtures/napoleon.py

### Installation

Waterloo itself requires Python 3.7 or later, but is primarily designed for projects having Python 2.7 source files.  
_(It can be run on Python 3 source files too, but since we add type-comments you will want to run the [comm2ann](https://github.com/ilevkivskyi/com2ann) tool afterwards to migrate those to Py3 annotations)._

For this reason it is best installed using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx):

```
$ pipx install waterloo
  installed package waterloo 0.7.8, Python 3.7.7
  These apps are now globally available
    - waterloo
done! ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
```

(NOTE: we currently have to install from GitHub due to using a forked version Bowler, PyPI installation will be available once our changes are upstreamed)

### Basic Usage

After we parse the docstrings and prepare the type comments (and imports of mentioned types), the resulting modifications to the files are performed by [Bowler](https://pybowler.io/). This tool provides a few nice features such as an optional interactive "diff" interface (or just preview diffs without writing changes yet as a "dry run").

In short you can...
```
waterloo annotate my-project-dir/ --write
```
...and it will derive type comments from all of your typed docstrings and add them to the files.

To preview the changes without committing them:
```
waterloo annotate my-project-dir/ --show-diff
```

Waterloo will _remove_ the type info from the docstrings, since it is now redundant. We assume you'll be using a type-checker like mypy to validate the annotations, so you don't want type info in the docstrings that can go outo of sync.

If you are using Sphinx to generate documentation from your docstrings you can use the [`sphinx-autodoc-typehints`](https://github.com/agronholm/sphinx-autodoc-typehints#using-type-hint-comments) plugin to ensure the type info is still present in your docs.

### CLI options

```
usage: waterloo annotate [-h] [-p PYTHON_VERSION] [-aa] [-rr]
                         [-ic {IMPORT,NO_IMPORT,FAIL}] [-up {IGNORE,WARN,FAIL}]
                         [-w] [-s] [-i]
                         F [F ...]

positional arguments:
  F                     List of file or directory paths to process.
```

**Annotation options:**

| arg  | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `-p --python-version` | We can refactor either Python 2 or Python 3 source files but the underlying bowler+fissix libraries need to know which grammar to use (to know if `print` is a statement or a function). In Py2 mode, `print` will be auto-detected based on whether a `from __future__ import print_function` is found. For Py3 files `print` can only be a function. We also use `parso` library which can benefit from knowing `<major>.<minor>` version of your sources. (default: `2.7`) |
| `-aa, --allow-untyped-args` | If any args or return types are found in docstring we can attempt to output a type annotation. If arg types are missing or incomplete, default behaviour is to raise an error. If this flag is set we will instead output an annotation like `(...) -> returnT` which mypy will treat as if all args are `Any`. (default: `False`) |
| `-rr, --require-return-type` | If any args or return types are found in docstring we can attempt to output a type annotation. If the return type is missing our default behaviour is to assume function should be annotated as returning `-> None`. If this flag is set we will instead raise an error. (default: `False`) |
| `-ic --import-collision-policy {IMPORT,NO_IMPORT,FAIL}` | There are some cases where it is ambiguous whether we need to add an import for your documented type. This can occur if you gave a dotted package path but there is already a matching `from package import *`, or a relative import of same type name. In both cases it is safest for us to add a new specific import for your type, but it may be redundant. The default option `IMPORT` will add imports. The `NO_IMPORT` option will annotate without adding imports, and will also show a warning message. FAIL will print an error and won't add any annotation. (default: `IMPORT`) |
| `-ut --unpathed-type-policy {IGNORE,WARN,FAIL}` | There are some cases where we cannot determine an appropriate import to add - when your types do not have a dotted path and we can't find a matching type in builtins, typing package or locals. When policy is `IGNORE` we will annotate as documented, you will need to resolve any errors raised by mypy manually. `WARN`option will annotate as documented but also display a warning. `FAIL` will print an error and won't add any annotation. (default: `FAIL`) |

**Apply options:**

| arg  | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `-w, --write` | Whether to apply the changes to target files. Without this flag set waterloo will just perform a 'dry run'. (default: `False`) |
| `-s, --show-diff` | Whether to print the hunk diffs to be applied. (default: `False`) |
| `-i, --interactive` | Whether to prompt about applying each diff hunk. (default: `False`) |

**Logging options:**

| arg  | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `-l, --enable-logging` | Enable structured logging to stderr. (default: `False`) |
| `-ll {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}, --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}` | Set the log level for stderr logging. (default: `INFO`) |
| `-q, --quiet` | 'quiet' mode for minimal details on stdout (filenames, summary stats only). (default: `False`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | 'verbose' mode for informative details on stdout (inc. warnings with suggested remedies). (default: `True`) |

**waterloo.toml**

You can also define a `waterloo.toml` file in the root of your project to provide your own defaults to some of these options:

```toml
python_version = 3

allow_untyped_args = false
require_return_type = true
unpathed_type_policy = "IGNORE"
import_collision_policy = "FAIL"
```

**Environment vars**

You can also provide config defaults via environment variables, e.g.:
```bash
WATERLOO_PYTHON_VERSION=3

WATERLOO_ALLOW_UNTYPED_ARGS=false
WATERLOO_REQUIRE_RETURN_TYPE=true
UNPATHED_TYPE_POLICY='IGNORE'
IMPORT_COLLISION_POLICY='FAIL'
```

### Notes on 'Napoleon' docstring format

The format is defined here https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For now we only support the "Google-style" option. Open an issue if you need the alternative "Numpy-style" format.

In addition to the [official list](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#docstring-sections) of Section headings we also allow `Kwargs:` (since I'd used that one myself in many places).

If you run waterloo with `--show-diff` option you will notice that we automatically add imports for the annotated types:

```diff
--- tests/fixtures/napoleon.py
+++ tests/fixtures/napoleon.py
@@ -2,6 +2,8 @@
 Boring docstring for the module itself
 """
 import logging
+from engine.models import Product
+from typing import Any, Callable, Dict, Iterable, List, Optional, Union

 logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Built-in types and those from `typing` module are recognised. For other types we can still generate the import as long as you use dotted-path syntax in the docstring, for example:

```python
"""
    Args:
        products (Union[Iterable[Dict], Iterable[engine.models.Product]])
        getter (Callable[[str], Callable])
"""
```

In this docstring, waterloo is able to add the `from engine.models import Product` import.

If your docstrings don't have dotted paths you will see warnings like:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  line 231: Ambiguous Type: MysteryType in docstring for def myfunc does not match any builtins, 
typing.<Type>, imported names or class def in the file, and does not provide a dotted-path we can
use to add an import statement. However there are some forms we cannot auto-detect which may mean
no import is needed.
   ‚û§ annotation added: will assume no import needed
```

Waterloo will still add the annotation to the function, but when you try to run mypy on this file it will complain that `MysteryType` is not imported (if `MysteryType` is not already imported or defined in the file). You will then have to resolve that manually.

You may want to run a formatter such as [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) on your code after applying annotations with waterloo, since it will just append the imports to the bottom of your existing import block.

### Upgrading your project to Python 3

Adding type comments with `waterloo` can be an intermediate step. You can start type checking with `mypy` while you're still on Python 2.7.

Later when you're ready to upgrade you can then run this other tool https://github.com/ilevkivskyi/com2ann
and it will convert the py2 type-comments into proper py3 type annotations.
