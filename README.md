#Â Python
```bash
pipenv shell
make test
```

This will (ultimately) parse python files with type-annotated docstrings specified in 'Napoleon'
format and re-apply the extracted annotations as mypy py2-compatible 'type comments'.

If your code is for Python 3 you can then run this tool https://github.com/ilevkivskyi/com2ann
and it will convert the py2 type-comments into py3 PEP-484 type annotations.
